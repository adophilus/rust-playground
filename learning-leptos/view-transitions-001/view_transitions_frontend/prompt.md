Hi there, I'm trying to learn about view-transitions and rust (leptos). Are you familiar with both of them?


Cool, I'm using v0.6.15 of leptos and it's using v0.3.70 of web_sys under the hood. There's a function in leptos `leptos::document` which is a function that enables access tot he underlying `Document` object. Here's the official docs below:
```rust
/// Returns the Document.
/// This is cached as a thread-local variable, so calling document() multiple times requires only one call out to JavaScript.
pub fn document() -> Document
```

The `Document` here is actually a reference to `web_sys::Document`. In the docs for the `web_sys::Document` there's a function which I'm interested in calling -- `start_view_transition`. Here's the official docs for it:
```rust
/// The startViewTransition() method.
/// MDN Documentation
/// This API requires the following crate features to be activated: Document, ViewTransition
/// This API is unstable and requires --cfg=web_sys_unstable_apis to be activated, as described in the wasm-bindgen guide
pub fn start_view_transition(&self) -> Result<ViewTransition, JsValue>
```

In my `Cargo.toml` file I have this line in there (which I added because I wanted to call the `start_view_transition` function):
```toml
web-sys = { version = "0.3.70", features = ["Document", "ViewTransition"] }
```

But even after that, it didn't work so I thought that I'd add the cfg block (which I got from the `web_sys` docs):
```toml
[build]
rustflags = ["--cfg=web_sys_unstable_apis"]
```

But even after that, I still get this error:
```

```


So here's what I want: I want to actually learn about this stuff so I'd like you to give me detailed explanations where necessary.
- I want to know what's going on with this error
- Why does adding `web_sys` v0.3.70 not have an effect? Or even adding the cfg block not have an effect on anything?
- Is there some special thing that happens when a crate re-exports structs from another crate? Is this even termed as a re-export (the `document()` function)?
